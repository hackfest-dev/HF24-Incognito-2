Hey, Arun. Both these are Cretas, right? Yep. Why? Do they look little different? This one's the n line. This one's the top spec SX option. Oh. Can you tell me the differences? Sure. That's what the regular Creta looks like. And on the end line, you get a sportier bumper, a different grille, the logos placed down below, and you get spotty red accents, too. 17 inch wheels there, 18 inch wheels here with the n line monogram and red brake calipers. A plain Jane looking rear there, a sporty rear here with a new bumper, dual tip exhaust and a spoiler. An all black interior theme with red accents, red ambient lighting, a brand new steering wheel. And the 1.5 turbo now gets a six speed manual. Absolutely no new features, but the price difference for all of this is just rs30,000, so I think it's worth it. Yes, it is.
