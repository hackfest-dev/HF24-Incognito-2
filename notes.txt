Hey, Arun. Both these are Cretas, right? Yep. Why? Do they look little different? This one's the n line. This one's the top spec SX option. Oh. Can you tell me the differences? Sure. That's what the regular Creta looks like. And on the end line, you get a sportier bumper, a different grille, the logos placed down below, and you get spotty red accents, too. 17 inch wheels there, 18 inch wheels here with the n line monogram and red brake calipers. A plain Jane looking rear there, a sporty rear here with a new bumper, dual tip exhaust and a spoiler. An all black interior theme with red accents, red ambient lighting, a brand new steering wheel. And the 1.5 turbo now gets a six speed manual. Absolutely no new features, but the price difference for all of this is just rs30,000, so I think it's worth it. Yes, it is.

I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to progress on our various projects, it's crucial to stay organized and mindful of our deadlines. I want to highlight some upcoming dates and reminders to ensure we stay on track. Firstly, the deadline for submitting the Project X proposal is April 15, 2024, so please ensure all required documentation is completed and submitted by then. Additionally, we have a crucial client meeting with ABC Corporation scheduled for April 20, 2024, at 10:00 AM, where we'll discuss project updates and address any client concerns. Don't forget about the monthly report submission due on April 25, 2024; let's ensure our progress and challenges are accurately documented. We also have a mandatory team training session on May 1, 2024, at 2:00 PM to familiarize ourselves with new software. Lastly, remember to submit all expense reports for reimbursement by May 5, 2024. Please mark these dates on your calendars and set reminders to avoid any last-minute rushes or oversights.
